# What is this Repo about? 

Most Linux users who are comfortable with the terminal might be using tons of different commands to make their lives easier.
Most often we get through by a quick search of stackoverflow or reddit or whatever. If such look ups are done for one-time projects 
or tasks they need not be saved. But for things we might need to do repeatedly at different instants in time, a documentation of these 
efforts become useful. I have a lot of such information stored in executable scripts. But if I want to use them in other scenarious I would have to 
decipher my own scripts and make them reusable. 

This repository can be used in conjuction with the `cheat` command in linux. This program is very minimal but useful. The program comes with its own
community generated cheatsheets to which users can add their own cheatsheets. Which is precisely what I have done in this repo. 

This repo contains my notes and documentation of various programs that I use on Linux. Additionally it might also contain other helpful information 
that I might want to summon immediately with a single command. This is how cheat is invoked on linux.

```
cheat tar # this provides all the information that I have associated with the tar command

```
