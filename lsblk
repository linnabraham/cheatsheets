# Since lsblk outputs a tree of devices and partitions by default, the 
# -l parameter is set for making it output a list and 
# -n for removing the list's header line. 
# -d means no dependencies, so no partitions, only real devices, and 
# -o path limits the output format to device paths, which is what we want, eg. /dev/sda or /dev/nvme1.

lsblk -lndo path

# print more info
lsblk -o name,size,type,mountpoint,label,uuid

# show partition information
lsblk -f
