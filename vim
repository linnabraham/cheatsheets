# change case
~ invert the case of the character under the cursor (i.e. lowercase becomes UPPERCASE and vice versa)
g~ followed by motion inverts the case of those characters
for example: g~e, g~$, g~iw, etc
gu followed by motion changes those characters to lowercase
for example: gue, gu$, guiw, etc
gU followed by motion changes those characters to UPPERCASE
for example: gUe, gU$, gUiw, etc

# use the surround plugin to enclose visual selection with paranthesis 
leader + Sb

It actually can do a lot of surrounding: various quotes, tags, etc.
It allows you to put cursor in the double-quoted word and change double quotes to single quotes by typing: cs"' (change-surround " to ').
Or you can completely delete quotes by typing ds" (delete-surround ").

Read the docs by link, it is really awesome!

# another way to surround with paranthesis is:
yss(

# surround with paraenthsis but without space
ysiwb

# to surround with curly braces
