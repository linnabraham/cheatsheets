# To create a footnote in Markdown, you will need two things, a superscript number and a footnote reference. A superscript number is created by placing a caret followed by a number inside a pair of square brackets.

[^number]

#A footnote reference is created by adding another caret and the same number used in a superscript inside square brackets. It is followed by a colon and text.

[^number]: text

#Note: GitHub flavored markdown does not support footnotes.
