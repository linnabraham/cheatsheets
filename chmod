# To recursively remove execute permissions from files without touching folders
If you are fine with setting the execute permissions for everyone on all folders:

chmod -R -x+X *
The -x removes execute permissions for all
The +X will add execute permissions for all, but only for directories.

# fix cannot ls permission issue
chmod 775 .

# give read write execute permission to other users in the same group as the owner(user)
sudo chmod 770 -R username
