REMOVE OPTIONS
       -c, --cascade
           Remove all target packages, as well as all packages that depend on one or more
           target packages. This operation is recursive, and must be used with care since it
           can remove many potentially needed packages.

       -k, --keep
           Removes the database entry only. Leaves all files in place.

       -n, --nosave
           Instructs pacman to ignore file backup designations. Normally, when a file is
           removed from the system the database is checked to see if the file should be
           renamed with a ".pacsave" extension.

       -s, --recursive
           Remove each target specified including all of their dependencies, provided that
           (A) they are not required by other packages; and (B) they were not explicitly
           installed by the user. This operation is recursive and analogous to a backwards
           --sync operation, and helps keep a clean system without orphans. If you want to
           omit condition (B), pass this option twice.

       -u, --unneeded
           Removes the targets that are not required by any other packages. This is mostly
           useful when removing a group without using the -c option, to avoid breaking any
           dependencies.
