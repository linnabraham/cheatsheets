To make free space by deleting Docker cache, you can follow the steps below:
Run the command docker system prune in your terminal. This will remove all stopped containers, dangling images, and cache.
If you want to remove only the cache, use the command docker builder prune. This will remove all builder cache.
To remove unused images, you can run the command docker image prune.
If you want to remove all unused data (containers, networks, images, and cache), use the command docker system prune -a.
If you want to specify a filter to remove only a specific type of cache, use the command docker builder prune --filter <filter>. For example, to remove all cache that is older than 48 hours, use docker builder prune --filter "until=48h".
Note that these commands will permanently delete data, so make sure you don't need any of the removed data before executing the commands.
