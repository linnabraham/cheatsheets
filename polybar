# Huge Emojis Problem: When using the Noto Emoji font, Emojis appear extremely big on the bar. Setting the size property doesn't help.
# This issue was discovered in #905.
Fix: Add the scale property to the font definition in your config. For example font-7 = NotoEmoji:scale=10. The larger the number the smaller the Emojis.
